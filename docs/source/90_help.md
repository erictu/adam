## Mailing List

[The ADAM mailing list](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/adam-developers) is a good
way to sync up with other people who use ADAM including the core developers. You can subscribe
by sending an email to `adam-developers+subscribe@googlegroups.com` or just post using
the [web forum page](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/adam-developers).

## IRC Channel

A lot of the developers are hanging on the [#adamdev](http://webchat.freenode.net/?channels=adamdev)
freenode.net channel. Come join us and ask questions.
